# Todolist-BackboneJS
Improved Todolist app using Backbone.js + Handlebars

### We'll need:
* a Todo model to describe individual todo items
* a TodoList collection to store and persist todos
* a way of creating todos
* a way to display a listing of todos
* a way to edit existing todos
* a way to mark a todo as completed
* a way to delete todos
* a way to filter the items that have been completed or are remaining
* _a way to mark a todo as starred_
* _a way to filter the items that are starred_
